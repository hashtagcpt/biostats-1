### Example 1: The "Infected!" Simulation Game ðŸŽ²
# This script runs a simple interactive game to simulate a "test" for infection.
# The player's chosen number is tested against a random value.

# --- THE SIMULATION FUNCTION ---
# This function calculates a single "test score".
doTheTest <- function(player_result, how_many_digits) {
  # The "test" involves a set of dice. We get a random outcome for each.
  d4   <- sample(1:4)
  d6   <- sample(1:6)
  d8   <- sample(1:8)
  d10  <- sample(1:10)
  d12  <- sample(1:12)
  d20  <- sample(1:20)
  d100 <- sample(seq(10, 100, by = 10))
  
  # The denominator is a complex random value based on the dice rolls.
  random_denominator <- sum(

    d100[1:how_many_digits] / 100

  # The final score is a ratio of the player's result to the total.
  score <- player_result / (player_result + random_denominator)

### Example 2: Simulating and Comparing Different Dice ðŸŽ²
# This script simulates a large number of rolls for different types of dice
# (d4, d6, etc.) to explore their statistical properties.

# --- THE SIMULATION ---
# Define the types of dice and how many times to roll each one.
dice_types <- c(4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20)
n_rolls <- 10000

# Use `map_dfr` to run a simulation for each die type and combine the
# results into a single, clean data frame.
all_rolls_data <- map_dfr(dice_types, ~{
  tibble(
    die = paste0("d", .x),
    roll = sample(1:.x, size = n_rolls, replace = TRUE)
  )
})

# --- SUMMARIZING THE RESULTS ---
# Calculate the mean and standard deviation for each type of die.
dice_summary <- all_rolls_data %>%
  group_by(die) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_roll = mean(roll),
    sd_roll = sd(roll)

# Print the summary table.
# The factor levels are reordered to ensure a logical d4 -> d20 order.
print(

    mutate(die = fct_relevel(die, "d4", "d6", "d8", "d10", "d12", "d20")) %>%
    arrange(die)
)

# --- VISUALIZING THE DISTRIBUTIONS ---
# A density plot shows the shape of each die's distribution.
# A single die roll has a flat (uniform) distribution.
ggplot(all_rolls_data, aes(x = roll, fill = die)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  # `facet_wrap` creates a separate plot for each die type.
